# Doubt-Solver

## What is Doubt Solver?
A one-stop application for the First Year Engineering Students of our college, which shows them the list of faculty teaching a particular course, and lets them ask doubts to them privately to the professor in case they are afraid of asking doubts in front of the whole class, at any time of the day, sitting anywhere, just by a few taps, and lets faculty members respond to doubts as per their convenience and availability.


## Scope
This android app helps students, particularly those studying in the First Year Of Engineering  clarify their doubts by showing a list of faculties teaching a particular course in college and providing them a medium so that students can ask doubts to faculty member(s) related to the topic of his/her doubt.  Faculty members can then respond to the doubts asked by students via the app. We have also given an option of adding FAQs for the faculty members, and for students to view them.
